# Sudoku Solver

## Overview

Welcome! I'm happy you checked out my Sudoku Solver Softwar, this is a interesting project designed to be able to solve Sudokus, right now it has the ability to solve frequently **Hard** sudoku problems. This is just a demo for trying to creat actually applications using Visual studio, and their Window Application framework. This was a challenge, on top of that another chalange was to desing the classes for the sudoku. Below is the scope for this project. 

* Loads a sudoku from a text file,
* Displays Sudoku Graphically
* Has a Step Feature, and A run Feature
* Can change the milisecond delay for the Run feature.
* Sudoku Techniques implemented:
    * Can Find Naked Singles
    * Can Find Hidden Singles
    * Can Find and Use Pointing Pairs & Triples.

The reason I wanted to do this is because a few weeks ago I got a Sudoku Book, and in it I had such a hard time solving a normal puzzle. In my fairness they were all rated **Hard**, so getting upset, I decided that if I wasnt bright enough to solve it, I certainly could make something that could solve it. During this project I think I am capable of solving most of the puzzles in the book, And I deffinately know that my Sudoku solver is too!

## Development Environment

### Tools Used
I just used Visual Studio Code and Git Hub, Using Git in visual studio code was simmple, you just sign in to git in their changes, and it walks your through the process. 

Using Visual Studio for this was also a learning curve, and honestly I really like VS, There is a really easy to use debug function, especially for windows applications, as any time you ran this application it was in Debug Mode, Something that I would like to learn more about is how to edit different Icons, and add more, as well as export this to an actual application. 

### Language Learned
I feel like for this I used mostly the basic libraries, however the hard part to use learn was the windows interface, and I understand there are a lot of different structs as well as frameworks that make this usefull. I didnt dive too deeply in this because I wanted a working product.

For my sudoku solver classes, I learned a lot about the std library and all the different classes and data types I have availables, I learned about vectors, as well as pairs, and these became a really important part of my program.

I also used different links from C++ class in College as I have just started that class a few weeks ago and wanted this to be a side project. 
## Future Work

In the future I want to add a few more things before this project is complete.
- Easier to read and more explicative user interface.
- The ability to manually put in a sudoku grid. 
- Bitmasks for solving more complex patterns and puzzles
- Export to an application that and update different Icons.
